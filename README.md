# LLM-Block-System

A NextJS toolkit that enables LLM-driven content experiences by leveraging reusable content blocks.

## Overview

LLM-Block-System is a toolkit for NextJS projects that empowers developers to create dynamic, LLM-driven content experiences using reusable content blocks. It serves as a bridge between large language models and component-based web applications, enabling AI to understand, generate, and explain web content while respecting the structure and design patterns of modern web development.

## Features

- Send content requirements to LLMs and receive structured block definitions
- Reference existing content blocks or generate new ones
- Stream real-time content updates with explanations
- Maintain full control over rendering and integration

## Project Status

This project is currently in early development. See the [Project Board](https://github.com/users/davidpp/projects) for current progress.
