# Block System Context

## Overview

The Block System Context functionality provides the core React context that manages the state and operations of the block system. It serves as the central state management system for the entire LLM-Block-System.

## Detailed Description

The Block System Context is implemented as a React context that stores:
- Current blocks and their metadata
- Explanations for blocks
- System status (loading, error, etc.)
- Error information

It exposes a set of functions and values for interacting with the block system:
- Setting and updating blocks
- Adding explanations
- Generating content through LLMs
- Resetting the system state

## Implementation Considerations

- Should be lightweight and performant
- Must use TypeScript for type safety
- Should minimize re-renders when possible
- Must be easy to access through a custom hook
- Should provide meaningful error handling

## Related Artifacts

| ID | Name | Type | Status | Location |
|----|------|------|--------|----------|
| ART-002 | context.tsx | component | active | src/lib/block-system/context.tsx |

## Dependencies

- Depends on ART-001 (types.ts) for type definitions

## Usage Example

```tsx
// In a component
import { useContext } from 'react';
import { BlockSystemContext } from '../lib/block-system/context';

function MyComponent() {
  const blockSystem = useContext(BlockSystemContext);
  
  if (!blockSystem) {
    throw new Error("Must be used within a BlockSystemProvider");
  }
  
  // Use block system context
}
```
