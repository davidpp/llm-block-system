# Rendering System Module

## Overview

The Rendering System module contains all components necessary for displaying blocks, handling errors, and providing visual feedback to users. It translates block structures into React components and manages the visual representation of the system.

## Responsibilities

- Rendering block structures as React components
- Managing component registry for block type resolution
- Handling error states and fallbacks
- Providing debug visualization tools
- Managing component boundaries and styling

## Key Functionalities

| ID | Name | Status | Description |
|----|------|--------|-------------|
| FUNC-010 | Block Renderer | planned | Component for rendering blocks |
| FUNC-011 | Error Boundary | planned | Error handling component |
| FUNC-012 | UI Components | planned | Default UI components for the system |
| FUNC-013 | Component Registry | planned | Registry for component lookup |

## Dependencies

- Depends on MOD-001 (Core System) for block definitions and context
- Depends on React for component rendering
- Uses TypeScript for type safety

## Implementation Notes

This module is primarily composed of React components that handle the visual representation of blocks. The BlockRenderer component is the main entry point, which uses the component registry to resolve block types to actual React components. Error boundaries ensure that the system can gracefully handle rendering failures.
