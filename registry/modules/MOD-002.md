# LLM Integration Module

## Overview

The LLM Integration module handles all communication with large language models using the Vercel AI SDK. It manages prompt construction, response parsing, streaming, and block generation from LLM outputs.

## Responsibilities

- Integrating with LLM providers via Vercel AI SDK
- Constructing effective prompts for LLMs
- Parsing JSON responses from LLMs
- Converting LLM responses into block structures
- Managing streaming updates for real-time content

## Key Functionalities

| ID | Name | Status | Description |
|----|------|--------|-------------|
| FUNC-006 | Vercel AI Integration | planned | Integration with Vercel AI SDK |
| FUNC-007 | Prompt Construction | planned | Utilities for building LLM prompts |
| FUNC-008 | JSON Stream Parsing | planned | Parser for streaming JSON responses from LLMs |
| FUNC-009 | Block Parsing | planned | Logic for parsing blocks from LLM responses |

## Dependencies

- Depends on MOD-001 (Core System) for type definitions and context
- Depends on Vercel AI SDK for LLM communication
- Depends on NextJS streaming capabilities

## Implementation Notes

This module serves as the bridge between LLMs and the block system. It transforms natural language prompts into structured block definitions that can be rendered by the system. The module is implemented as a set of utilities and parsers that handle the complexities of working with streaming JSON responses.
