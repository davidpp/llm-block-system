# Core System Module

## Overview

The Core System module provides the fundamental infrastructure for the LLM-Block-System, including context providers, state management, type definitions, and core hooks. It establishes the foundation upon which all other modules build.

## Responsibilities

- Defining core data structures and types
- Managing application state with React context and hooks
- Providing the primary API surface for developers
- Ensuring type safety throughout the system
- Centralizing block system configuration

## Key Functionalities

| ID | Name | Status | Description |
|----|------|--------|-------------|
| FUNC-001 | Block System Context | active | Core context provider for the block system |
| FUNC-002 | Block System Provider | planned | React provider component with state management |
| FUNC-003 | Type Definitions | active | TypeScript interfaces for the system |
| FUNC-004 | Validation Schemas | planned | Zod schemas for validation |
| FUNC-005 | Block System Hooks | planned | React hooks for accessing block system functionality |

## Dependencies

- Depends on React for context and hooks
- Depends on TypeScript for type definitions
- Depends on Zod for schema validation

## Implementation Notes

This module forms the backbone of the LLM-Block-System and is implemented as a set of TypeScript files in the `src/lib/block-system` directory. It provides a React-friendly API surface through context providers and hooks, making it easy to integrate into NextJS applications.
