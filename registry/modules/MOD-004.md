# Content Generation Module

## Overview

The Content Generation module provides interfaces and components for prompting LLMs to generate content. It handles the user-facing aspects of content creation, including form inputs, prompting UI, and control over the generation process.

## Responsibilities

- Providing UI components for content prompting
- Managing user inputs for content generation
- Communicating with LLM integration module
- Handling loading states during generation
- Processing generated content for display

## Key Functionalities

| ID | Name | Status | Description |
|----|------|--------|-------------|
| FUNC-014 | Content Prompt | planned | Component for user prompts |
| FUNC-015 | Block Generation | planned | LLM-based content generation |

## Dependencies

- Depends on MOD-001 (Core System) for block definitions and context
- Depends on MOD-002 (LLM Integration) for communicating with LLMs
- Depends on MOD-003 (Rendering System) for displaying generated content

## Implementation Notes

This module bridges the user interface with the LLM integration layer. It provides React components that collect user inputs, send them to the LLM, and handle the response processing. The ContentPrompt component is the primary interface for users to request new content.
